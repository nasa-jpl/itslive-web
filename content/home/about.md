Satellite observations reveal how the worldâ€™s glaciers have responded to recent changes in climate, and can inform predictions of future sea level rise. To enable the next generation of ice sheet models and process-based studies, ITS_LIVE provides a decades-long, high-resolution record of global ice velocity and elevation change. The cloud-based ITS_LIVE architecture continually processes and synthesizes new data from multiple optical, radar, and laser satellite sensors, resulting in a high-resolution, low-latency product that can be used for scientific studies within days of data collection.
